Oral Histories Functionality for Islandora 2.0+

Notes:
 - adjust the context rules for Audio + Video
 - add Taxonomy for "Transcript Text" and ensure the uri for "Transcript" is as needed.
 
 Create an object that uses Model = "video" and Type = "Moving Image" -- add an xml vtt media and be sure to have the Media Use = "Transcript" (also, add a Video as original file and make the service file from it).
